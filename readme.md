# Instructions
Create a node API with Unit tests. Each Developer team member is responsible for creating a unique route and corresponding unit test.

Utilize a Feature Branch Git Workflow to work with your teammates to deploy code to Github.com and utilize their web hooks automate deployments to a Live Server, hosted on DigitalOcean when code is pushed to a `release` branch.

The Cloud Engineer is responsible for maintaining uptime on the Live Server and should utilize a service like PM2 to this end.
